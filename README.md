This is my BlackJack implementation in C++ using OOP principles. I have covered every part and function of the original game with its original rules. Currently, it is designed for a single player only. 
The project has only one dependency: 'nlohmann/json', which you can find and install from here: (https://github.com/nlohmann/json). I used 'vcpkg' (https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) for the installation.
Have fun, and remember not to gamble in real casinos. Play my Blackjack!
